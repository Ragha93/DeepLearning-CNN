# DeepLearning-CNN
This repositry contains all the Deeplearning materials 

#### 1. Project_Image_classification.ipynb - We do basic Image classification using Neural Networks, ML algorithm (Logit) and CNN models. We have also applied transfer learning by using ResNet-50, ResNet-152 and MobileNet-V2-130-224 by importing them from Tensorflowhub. For more details : https://tfhub.dev/

#### 2. Project_9 (2).ipynb - This project contains Face detection using Mask Detection model in part 1. Part 2 contains Face detection with bounding box coordinates using pretrained weights from cascade classifier and Mask Detection model with CV2's contours, Part 3 Face recognition using Siamese networks and Part 4 contains object detection in video, created using pretrained Instance segmentation
