# DeepLearning-CNN
This repositry contains all the Deeplearning materials 

#### 1. Project_Image_classification.ipynb - We do basic Image classification using Neural Networks, ML algorithm (Logit) and CNN models. We have also applied transfer learning by using ResNet-50, ResNet-152 and MobileNet-V2-130-224 by importing them from Tensorflowhub. For more details : https://tfhub.dev/
